general question:

can i use the same packing for SIMD CPU GEMM kernels for SIMT GPU GEMM kernels?



80 Volta MPs
2048 threads per MP
64 warps per MP
96 KB shared memory per MP
48 KB shared memory per thread blocks

L2 Cache size = 4608 KB


Number of times a TC will be used in a wmma instruction is WMMA_
- number comes from doing size of 

equation to determine number of bytes per wmma

    A takes (mr)(k_wmma)(S_data_in)
    B takes (nr)(k_wmma)(S_data_in)
    C takes (mr)(nr)(S_data_out)

total = (mr)(k_wmma)(S_data_in) + (nr)(k_wmma)(S_data_in) + (mr)(nr)(S_data_out)
      = (k_wmma) (S_data_in) (mr+nr) + (mr)(nr)(S_data_out)

thus in shgemm we get

    A and B both take (WMMA_)(WMMA_)(2) = 512
    C takes (WMMA_)(WMMA_)(4) = 1024

    total = 2*512 + 1024 = 2048 bytes per wmma in shgemm


my approach:

each thread in a warp will get the same address of the result matrix

therefore we need equations to calculate the address

assumptions:

split shared memory by half
1 warp = 1 block
32 threads = 1 warp



total wmma calls 

(m*n*k) / (wmma_m * wmma_n * wmma_k)
